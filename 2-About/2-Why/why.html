        <p class="ques">Why?</p><br><br><br>
        <p class="information">The degree of equivalence between the energy entering the planet's system and the energy reflected back into space determines
             the temperature of the Earth. The Earth's surface can either reflect sunlight back into space or absorb it.  A portion of the heat 
             (infrared radiation) produced by the absorbed energy is subsequently discharged back into the atmosphere, further heating the 
             planet. This is a routine procedure.<br><br>
             However, there is human intervention at play. The world becomes warmer than it was previously due to greenhouse gases 
             released from numerous sources that trap heat. Even if there are slight variations in temperature over time, they eventually 
             become significant.
